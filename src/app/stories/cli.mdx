# CLI

Effortlessly manage and install packages from the Teenage Interface library with an interactive, command-line experience.

## Installation

To install the CLI globally, run the following command:
```bash
npm install -g @teenageinterface/cli
```

Alternatively, you can add it to your project as a development dependency:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @teenageinterface/cli
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the tgi command in your terminal to install packages.

### Install a single package

To install a specific package, run the following command:
```bash
tgi install [name]
```

### Install all packages

To install all available packages, use the --all option or the -a alias:
```bash
tgi install --all
# or
tgi install -a
```

### Interactive installation

If you don't specify a package, the CLI will prompt you to select one or more packages interactively. Use the following command:
```bash
tgi install
```

You will be presented with a list of available packages to choose from.

### Help

For more information on the available commands, run:
```bash
tgi --help
```

This will display all available commands, descriptions, and options.
